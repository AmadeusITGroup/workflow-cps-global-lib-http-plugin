The current official plugin [workflow-cps-global-lib](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-global-lib-plugin/) does provide a way to retrieve shared libraries through a SCM, such as Git. The goal of this plugin is to provide another way to retrieve shared libraries via the *@Library* declaration in a Jenkinsfile.

This is a way to separate to concerns : source code (SCM) and built artefacts (binaries). Built artefacts are immutable, tagged and often stored on a different kind of infrastructure. Since pipelines can be used to make production loads, it makes sense to host the libraries on a server with a production-level SLA for example. You can also make sure that your artefact repository is close to your pipelines and share the same SLA. Having your Jenkins and your artefact repository close limits latency and limits network issues.

## Context

The HTTP shared libraries retriever was implemented to retrieve [shared libraries](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/) through HTTP (or HTTPs) instead of a SCM.

## Installation of the plugin

### Installing from source

You can follow the steps hereafter to install the plugin:

* Clone the sources of this repository
* Run ```mvn package``` in order to compile the sources and package them in a .hpi file
* Follow the [instructions that can be found on the Jenkins website](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/plugins/#installing-a-plugin) and install the plugin that has been packaged in ```target/http-shared-lib.hpi```

### Installing from artefact

#### Installing from the Plugins site

The plugin is referenced as an official plugin in the Jenkins update site, so you should be able to use the integrated search in the Plugin section.

#### To install the plugin manually

You can find the archives of all the version of the Plugin on the [Update site](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps-global-lib-http).
You can also Download the wished plugin release from the Github releases section.
The, go to the Jenkins Administration Plugins UI > Advanced section and upload the plugin .hpi file.

## How to use the plugin

### Pre-requisite: package the library

In order to be able to use this plugin, you need to package your library (probably durng a Continuous Integration build) and publish it in a location accessible via HTTPS.
You should end up with a ZIP file with the following structure:

```bash
> unzip -vl pipeline-libraries.zip
Archive:  pipeline-libraries.zip
 Length   Method    Size  Cmpr    Date    Time   CRC-32   Name
--------  ------  ------- ---- ---------- ----- --------  ----
     xxx  Defl:N      xxx  37% 03-21-2019 12:14 7d354e1f  resources/a-rsc-needed
    xxxx  Defl:N     xxxx  68% 03-21-2019 12:14 fefba77f  src/your/package/YourGroovyClass.groovy
     xxx  Defl:N      xxx  33% 03-21-2019 12:14 5b6808ab  vars/yourvar.groovy
     xxx  Defl:N      xxx  39% 03-21-2019 12:14 5842cc52  vars/yourvar.txt
      xx  Defl:N       xx  -7% 03-21-2019 12:19 1bd0fa25  version.txt
--------          -------  ---                            -------
  xxxxxx           xxxxxx  x%                            n files
```

If you want to package it like this with maven, you can use the following.
In your pom.xml

```xml
<build>
   <plugins>
      <plugin>
            <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>2.6</version>
            <executions>
               <execution>
                  <configuration>
                        <finalName>your-library</finalName>
                        <descriptors>
                           <descriptor>assembly.xml</descriptor>
                        </descriptors>
                  </configuration>
                  <id>make-assembly1</id>
                  <phase>package</phase>
                  <goals>
                        <goal>single</goal>
                  </goals>
               </execution>
            </executions>
      </plugin>
   </plugins>
</build>
```

The assembly.xml file:

```xml
<assembly xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly/1.1.3"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly/1.1.3 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/assembly-1.1.3.xsd">
  <id>sources</id>

  <formats>
    <format>zip</format>
  </formats>

  <includeBaseDirectory>false</includeBaseDirectory>

  <fileSets>
    <fileSet>
      <directory>.</directory>
      <outputDirectory>/</outputDirectory>
      <lineEnding>unix</lineEnding>
      <includes>
        <include>src/**</include>
        <include>vars/**</include>
        <include>resources/templates/*.json</include>
        <include>resources/*.sh</include>
        <include>version.txt</include>
      </includes>
    </fileSet>
  </fileSets>

</assembly>
```

### Constraints

*The plugin supports only ZIP shared libraries format for the moment.*

### Setup of the plugin

The plugin is configurable on the Jenkins UI, at different levels:

* On Global System Configuration page (Administration)
* On Folder Configuration page
* On Pipeline Configuration page

Jenkins administrators can set [global libraries on the Administration page](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#global-shared-libraries), while Jenkins users can set libraries either on the [Folder view](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#folder-level-shared-libraries) or on the Pipeline view.

The generic documentation to reference a new shared library can be found [here](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#using-libraries).

### In the Jenkins UI

In Administration / Folder / Pipeline configuration views:

* Go to the Global Pipeline Libraries section and add a new library. You should see 3 different retrieval methods: HTTP, Modern SCM and Legacy SCM.
* Give it a name and a default version
* Decide if you want to load it implicitly or not
![Administration UI](doc/HTTPRetrieverAdminConfig.png)
* Provide the URL and the credentials (only if needed) used to retrieve the shared libraries: 

*In our case, we provide an Artifactory URL that retrieves shared libraries source code packaged into a zip archive.*

The URL of the HTTP retriever is version-dynamic, it follows the Jenkins standard annotation *${library.\<library\_name\>.version}* that is afterwards replaced either by the default version provided by the admin, or the version specified by the user Jenkinsfile in the *@Library* annotation.

### Directly in the Jenkinsfile

Users can also retrieve shared libraries from their Jenkinsfile, by defining it with this syntax:

```groovy
library identifier: 'external-shared-libraries@4.1.0', retriever: http(
   credentialsId: 'CREDS_ID',
   httpURL: 'https://my-artifactory.com/mvn-repository/path/to/libraries/external-shared-libraries/${library.external-shared-libraries.version}/external-shared-libraries-${library.external-shared-libraries.version}.zip')
```
